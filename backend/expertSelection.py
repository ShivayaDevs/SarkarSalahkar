    This performs the core step in maintaining the quality of the community, 
    matching the suggested solutions with people from within the community, 
    normal users who have been promoted because of their impact, to become 
    subject-level-experts. The solutions are escalated to them on the basis of
    several factors, which are as follows:
        a) Their past performance on the platform
        b) Their reputation
        c) Their escalation history
        d) How good are the ideas that they escalate(i.e. a percentage measure of 
           acceptance by higher authorities)
        e) Previous history with the current user.
        f) Availibility
        g) Their expertise in subject (this also comes from the designation of a person
           eg. Senior officials who have proven record in the offline world of expertise)
        
    The ideas are evaluated by these one-level-above(L+) experts and a decision to 
    escalate or not is made by the expert. The judging by an expert depends on him 
    (don't worry he won't reject good ideas because then he would not gain rep, and 
    he won't escalate bad ideas because then he'll lose rep). So, reputation helps in
    maintaining the quality of our community.
    
    Using these methods, Sarkar Salahkar can guarantee a platform that solves one of the 
    biggest problems in our democracy -> Bridging the gap between citizens and government
    in decision making and representation.
    A platform that ensures
        -> Quality of the solutions on platform.
        -> No overwhelming/bombarding requests to authorities
        -> Ensuring best solutions which are really impactful don't get lost amongst billions of others.
        => Simplicity to make it suitable to every Indian citizen.
        -> Spammers unable to clutter the platform and flood irrelevant posts.
