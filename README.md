## Mission
To help people’s ideas and solutions to reach the people in power who can take action on them and allows them to make an impact on present situations. 

## Requirement
A good proportion of our population is highly skilled, innovative and can really suggest simple and creative ways to solve the problems faced by the citizens. Presently, there isn’t much opportunity for a common man to suggest ideas/solutions to the government. Neither they feel they have power to do that. There is a gap between government and citizen’s representation in decision making.

## Top Challenges
1. But how do we make these solutions (advice) by the people reach the people who can take action and can really make our country better?<br>
2. How do we prevent over 1.2 billion citizens from not bombarding/ovewhelming the authorities with their suggestions (ie spam and infeasible ones)?<br>
3. Around 20% of the solutions are really great, implementable and have a potential to produce impact. So, how can we keep a quality first platform that keeps the users and authorities both engaged?

# Our Solution
Introducing Sarkar Salahkar, an app that lets people’s solution reach people in power. Sarkar Salahkar utilizes the power of community and algorithms together to segregate, validate and escalate feasible, implementable and impact producing solutions to the people who can take action. <br>
People with diverse backgrounds and skills unite around a common goal to collaborate with other thinkers and doers to make the world’s largest democracy the best it can be.

## How?
We’ve made the process of writing, publishing and escalating ideas on the platform a playful activity to keep users engaged. The process is simple for users and is handled by powerful algorithms :<br>
1. User writes his/her idea/solution.<br>
2. Text is analysed to generate an understanding of the domain, department, target authority and tags to be applied. These tags help to find the target department/domain to communicate this idea to.<br>
3. Idea Escalation: App suggests higher level experts to escalate the idea. Every person is associated with a reputation. Experts are people with higher reputations than the person writing the idea.<br>
Reputation is assigned according to person’s expertise, past performances, availability and escalation impact produced. Good members of the community who make more impact earn reputation points. More the reputation points the better your impact and knowledge. And loss of reputation for escalating spam.<br>
Our algorithms escalate the solutions by assorting the community members into levels and escalating the idea through them without overwhelming any single user.<br>
4. Feasible ideas gets to people in position and power. They can take action accordingly. Our mission is successful.

## Impact
1. Using Sarkar Salahkar, the gap between government and people in terms of representation in decision making is bridged.<br>
2. Only the implementable and impactful solutions reach from the people to authority without overwhelming the authorities with spams.<br>
3. Citizens are made a part of decision making.  It’ll end up making them an integral part of government and ensure a better democracy and representation. <br>
4. This makes use of unutilised power of citizens to solve problems and helps in making current situations better.<br>
5. People with diverse backgrounds and skills unite around a common goal to collaborate with other thinkers and doers to make the world’s largest democracy the best it can be.<br>
6. Community keeps functioning in a playful way, earning reputation points to make India better.
